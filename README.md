# Localization fix for vox populi
**Latest version: v2 Alpha for Vox Populi V12.1.3**
Fix all wrong data from CBO for non-english installs.

**note** This is not a translation mod, only will fix all wrong data from policies, buildings, wonders , tech, civilizations, leaders and units that has been rebalanced by CBO. 


### Requeriments

* Non-english install of the game
* (1) Community Patch
* (2) Community Balance Patch

### Tested Mods

* Working with all VP Mods:
  - Community Patch
  - Community Balance Overhaul
  - City State Diplomacy Mod
  - Civ IV Diplomatic Features
  - More Luxuries
  - CBO Compatibility Files (only tested with EUI version -6a- but should work with non EUI too)
  - Promotion Icons for VP
  - UI - Promotion Tree for VP
* Also tested with Jarcast's The Amazons (v 2) 

### Download and Install

This is a work in progress yet, for now the best way to get the files is by forking this repo.

* **Files you need** Everything on es_ES folder
* **Files needed for Non-Spanish Installs** Everything in en_US folder
* **Install** Copy /LFFVP to My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS/
  - Don't forget to delete cache folder before launch the game! (Games/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/cache)
* **Enable** Enable every VP mod, then enable (at last) "Localization Fix for Vox Populi".

### Non-Spanish installs - IMPORTANT

I will made some packages for any language when I get the final version (after fixing some strings from other mods) in the mean time the best way to get this mod working to another languages like german is by editing the "en_US" folder, use this one as a base.

- Replace every "Language_en_US" with your localization prefix. (eg. Language_de_DE for german)

### Translations

Spanish version already have some translations made, on next versions I will deliver this mod 100% in spanish, also add that 60% german that was translated in the past for the community on [The Vox Populi Localization Project](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/the-vox-populi-localization-project.609232/).
